PART A
1. (a)                   (i)       Perform   the   following   calculation.    Give   your   answer   in   scientiﬁc   notation   to four   signiﬁcant   ﬁgures.

(ii)       Convert the   angle   112 degrees into radians.    Give your   answer   correct   to   two   decimal   places.
(b)       Consider   the   following   equation   for   the   mass   W   in   grams   of   a   radioactive   isotope   in   a   sample,   where   t   is   in   years:

(i)         What is the mass of radioactive   isotope   in   the   sample   at   t   =   0?   What   is   the mass   of   radioactive   isotope   in   the   sample   after   20   years   according   to   this equation?   Express   your   answer   correct   to   three   signiﬁcant   ﬁgures. 
(ii)       Express   W   in   the   form   Aekt.

(c)       Consider   the   four   sketches   of curves   given   below.    For   each   curve,   say   whether   the   relationship   that   it   plots   is   linear,   quadratic,   exponential   or   periodic.      You   may   assume   that   the   axes   cross   at   the   origin   (0   ;   0).

PART B 
2. Dilution problems. In   chemistry,   biochemistry,   pharmocology   and   other   medical   sci-   ences,    students   are   often   required   to   dilute   a   highly   concentrated   solution   to   make   a   solution   with   a   lower   concentration   of solute.    Here   the   solute is   the   dissolved   substance.   The   substance   that   does   the   dissolving,   eg   water   is   call   the   solvent.
The   equation   which   is   used   to   ﬁnd   how   much   solvent   needs   to   be   added   to   a   highly   concentrated   solution   to   produce   a   solution   of   a   given,   weaker   concentration   is:
C1   V1    =   C2   V2   ,where   C1    is   the   concentration   of substrate   in   stronger   solution   and   V1    is   its   volume   and   C2    is   the   concentration   that   is   required   in   the   weaker   solution   and   V2    is   the   volume   of   that   solution.   Here we will   assume that   concentration   is   measured   in   moles per   litre   and   volume   is   measured   in   litres.
Note   that      chemists      use   the      symbol      M   to   represent      moles   per      litre.       We   will    use   this   convention   in   this   question.
(a)       Usually   a   lab   scientist   wants   to   know   what   will   be   the   new   volume   of   a   solution that has   been   diluted   to   a   given   concentration.    We   can   ﬁnd   this   out   by   ﬁnding   V2   .      Express   V2      as   a   function   of   C1   ,   C2      and   V1      by   making   V2      the   subject   of   the   equation   above. 
(b)       Some   students   want   to   dilute   a   solution   of   HCl   with   concentration   of   0.5   M   to   make   a   solution   where   the   concentration   of   HCl   is   0.1   M.   They   start   with   100   ml   of   the   solution   with   concentration   of   0.5   M.   When   this   is   diluted   to   0.1   M   what   volume of the weaker solution will they   get?    How   much water   do   they   need   to   add   to   the   original   solution   to   obtain   a   solution   with   concentration   of 0.1   M   of HCl? 
(c)         In   another   experiment, the   students   need   50ml   of solution with   a   concentration   of 0.2   M   of   HCl.   What   volume   of the   0.5   M   solution   do   they   need   to   obtain   exactly   50ml   of   the   0.2   M   solution?
3. Solar power take-up. Read   the   following   web   story   about   the   world   wide   take-up   of   solar   panel   technology   for   electricity   generation:
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-12-18/survey-of-the-worlds-solar-shows-global-boom/104006096 .(This   link   is   also   given   on   the   Assignment   1   page,   so   you   can   click   directly   on   it.)   There   are   several   graphs   in   this   story.      This   question   asks   you   to   think   about   some   of   these   graphs   and 代 写MATH1050: Mathematics Toolbox for Science Assignment 1 Semester 1, 2025C/C++
代做程序编程语言  other   parts   of   the   story   in   more   detail.    Please   note   that   if   you   hover   your   cursor over some of the curves on the graphs, this   displays   the   data   that   has   been   plotted   at   that   point.   This   may   be   useful   in   answering   the   following   questions.
(a)         In   this   web   story,   an   energy   analyst,   speaking   about   the   proportion   of power   that   is   generated   from   solar   panels   says,   If   I   do   the   maths,   from   0.5   per   cent   to   5   per   cent   [of global power] takes   about the same   time   as   from   5   per   cent   to   80   per   cent.   Is   this   rate   of growth
•      exponential,
•      faster   than   exponential,   or
•      slower   than   exponential?
Justify   your   answer.
(b)         About   halfway   through   the   story,   there   is   a   series   of   graphs   that   show   how   solar   is   outpacing   fossil   fuels   in   India.   Unfortunately,   no   units   are   given   on   the   vertical   axes   of these   plots,   so   we   will just   say   these   are   in    “energy   units”.Consider   the   ﬁrst   graph   of   the   series   which   describes   the   number   of   energy   units   generated   from   fossil   fuels   as   a   function   of time   in   years   from   2000   to   2023.    This looks like a sigmoid curve whose functional form. is  where t is the inde   pendent   variable.
(i)         Let   the   independent   variable   t   be   the   time   in   years   from   2000.    Estimate   a   suitable   maximal   asymptote value   M.   Hence ﬁnd   a   suitable value of   K,   the   half maximal   value.
(ii)       Using   your   values   for   M   and   K,   experiment   with   Mathematica   to   ﬁnd   a   suitable   value   for   n.    That   is,   use   Mathematica   to   plot  with your   values   of   M   and   K   but   with   diﬀerent   values   of n.   What   value(s)   of n gives   a   plot that   is   most   similar to that   in the   web   story?    (Please   include   enough   of your   Mathematica   output   to justify   your   choice   of n.)
(iii)         We   can represent this   curve   quite well by   a   sigmoid   curve   for   the   years   from2000   to   2023.    But   what   do   you   think   this   curve   might   look   like   if   we   were   able   to   plot   fossil   fuel   usage   between   2000   and   2040?      Why   do   you   think   this?   Is it valid to use a   sigmoid   curve   to   approximate   this   function   between   2000   and   2023?   Why   or   why   not?
(c)         About   two   thirds   of the   way   through   the   story   there   is   graph   headed   ”The   global   south   is   shifting   more   quickly”.         Each   of   the   three   curves   on   this   graph   can   be   modelled   by   the   function
0.5   × ekt
where t is time in years   from   when   uptake   of solar   reached   0.5%   of the   energy   mix. 
(i)         For   each   curve,   estimate   the   values   of   t   and   energy   uptake   at   three   or   four   points on that curve.       Your estimate    for    energy uptake should be to at   least   two   signiﬁcant   ﬁgures, so   you   will   need   to   estimate   from   the   graph   because      hovering   your cursor   will only   give one signiﬁcant   ﬁgure.       Using   Mathematica,   plot   these   points   and   the   point   (0   ,   0.5)   on   a   graph.
(ii)       Use the Show[] command in Mathematica to   plot   0.5 ×   ekt    for various   values of   k,   on   the   same   set   of   axes   as   your   data   points.    Use   these   Mathematica experiments   to   ﬁnd   k   and   hence   an   explicit   model   for   solar   power   uptake for   each   of   Greater   China,   the   Global   South   and   the   Global   North.
(iii)       How   much   faster   is   solar   uptake   growing   in   China   compared   to   the   Global   North?
(iv)         Do   you   think   that   these   exponential   models   will   be   valid   indeﬁnitely?   Why   or   why   not?    If   not,   what   type   of   model   do   you   think   would   be   better   over   the   next   ﬁfty   to   100   years?
